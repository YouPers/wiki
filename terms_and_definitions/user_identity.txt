====== User Identity ======

A user is identified

  * by his user-id and/or by his e-mail in combination with his password, when registering or when signing in to a service.
  * always by his first and last name within a service, when interacting with other users.

It's clear that a user could enter fake first and last names. Nevertheless, we aim at convincing users to use their real names.
