====== Information channels ======


Looking at other platforms and mobile apps with a sharing community it seems best practice to let the recipient of an [[terms_and_definitions:social_interactions|information]] decide which channel he wants to receive information on. The sender ideally shares information out of a specific context (e.g. inviting someone to a [[terms_and_definitions:group_activity|group activity]], starting a [[terms_and_definitions:conversations|conversation]] on an activity recommendation) without caring which channel is going to be used by the recipient. So if user A invites other users to a group activity, user B might receive a push [[terms_and_definitions:notifications|notification]] whereas user C receives an e-mail and user D sees the invitation only when accessing the application and looking at the [[terms_and_definitions:application_inbox|inbox-style area]].

Following channels are available
  * inbox-style area in web app / mobile app where received information is
    * asynchronous when the user is offline
    * synchronous when the user is online
  * e-mail (always asynchronous)
  * push notification (always synchronous)

For these information channels we provide [[terms_and_definitions:defaults_for_social_interactions|defaults]] which the user can modify (with some unmodifiable exceptions.
