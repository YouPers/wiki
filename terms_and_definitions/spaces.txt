====== Spaces ======

Space is used as a metaphor for the “place” within an application where a user does interactions with the application. Thus, space also helps to identify the degree of visibility/intimacy/privacy an object has when the object is in a specific space. As example, the object [[terms_and_definitions:self_assessment|self assessment]] is always in a space which is known to the user as being private and thus only visible to him and the [[terms_and_definitions:digital_health_coach|digital health coach]]. Whereas the object “personal invitation to participate to a [[terms_and_definitions:group_activity|group activity]]” will be in a space which is visible to the person who sends the invite as well to the one receiving it.

The spaces as perceived by the [[terms_and_definitions:user|user]] are:

===== Private Space =====


So far only one type of private space is used, the private space. Within this private space there are objects which are only visible to the user, e.g.

  * self assessment
  * diary

Only the user and the digital health coach can “see” this objects. The digital health coach needs to see the objects in the private space in order to give suggestions, hints and support.

It could be that in future releases private space objects could be made confidential (see next section) if for example a user wants to share parts of the diary with his doctor or his life partner.

===== Restricted Space =====


Restricted spaces are similar to the “closed user group” concept and are always embedded in a specific context. Ideally the creation as well as the closing of such confidential spaces happens automatically without the user needing to do a specific action.

Restricted spaces known so far:

==== Campaign ====


All employees who joined a [[terms_and_definitions:campaign|campaign]] share this restricted space together with the [[terms_and_definitions:campaign_manager|campaign manager(s)]] for this campaign, thus sharing objects such as

  * campaign info
  * campaign statistics
  * [[terms_and_definitions:activity|activity]] recommendations issued by the campaign manager
  * news sent by the campaign manager
  * planned group activities where the planner of the group activity decided that “everybody can participate”

==== Organization ====


All employees who joined any campaign of the same organization share this restricted space. This gives the campaign managers the possibility to share for example

  * common recommendations for all campaigns
  * common invitations to introductory events
  * campaign-independent group activities

==== Group activities ====


People joining the same group activity share a common restricted space where they can exchange information related to this group activity.

==== Caregiver / Caretaker ====


The informal [[terms_and_definitions:caregiver|caregiver]] and the [[terms_and_definitions:caretaker|caretaker]] share a restricted space to exchange any sort of actions and information, e.g. in the context of AAL project INSPIRATION.

==== Examples within a restricted space ====


<WRAP center round box 80%>
If user A accepts an invitation for a group activity from user B, all actions and objects related to this group activity occur/are in the confidential space belonging to this group activity (which in this case is the context for this confidential space). Both users need to know (e.g. by means of visual clues/hints) that they are in the confidential space belonging to this group activity.

</WRAP>

<WRAP center round box 80%>
If I share parts of my diary with my doctor, then this confidential space consists of
  * the shared parts of the diary
  * the actions the doctor and I can do with this shared parts of the diary.
In this case the shared parts of the diary are the context for this confidential space.

</WRAP>


<WRAP center round box 80%>
If I share my YouPers account (or parts of) with my life partner, then again all shared parts as well as the actions belonging to these shared parts belong to this confidential space.

</WRAP>

<WRAP center round box 80%>
If a caretaker and his informal caregiver (e.g. in Inspiration) share objects such as food recommendations, activity lists, location data of the caretaker, then all these objects and the actions belonging to them are in this confidential space.

</WRAP>

==== Visibility within restricted spaces ====


In some restricted spaces a user knows all other users which share the same restricted space. This is the case for group activities and the caregiver/caretake relationship.
In other restricted spaces the user does not know all other users sharing the same space. This is true for organization and for campaign.

===== Public space =====


This space is visible to all users. YouPers announcements (e.g. for new services, apps, etc.) most likely will be the first “object” in the public space.
