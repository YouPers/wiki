====== Defaults for social interactions ======

These are defaults for social interactions and their [[terms_and_definitions:information_channels|information channels]]:

===== Messages =====

  * [[terms_and_definitions:messages|Messages]] sent to a user are always displayed as [[terms_and_definitions:notifications|notifications]] in the [[terms_and_definitions:application_inbox|application inbox]]. The [[terms_and_definitions:user|user]] is not able to overwrite this behavior.
  * The user can decide, if he additionally wants to receive these messages as e-mail messages. We still need to decide, if this behavior is switched on or off by default. At a later stage we might need overwritable defaults for different types of messages (e.g. a default for invitations, one for announcements, etc.)
  * The user can decide, if he additionally wants to receive push notifications for these messages within the mobile app. Push notifications are switched on by default. 

===== Conversations =====

  * The user receives notifications on updated [[terms_and_definitions:conversations|conversations]] he is subscribed to in the application inbox. He cannot overwrite this behavior.
  * The user can decide, if he additionally wants to receive these notifications as e-mail messages. We still need to decide, if this behavior is switched on or off by default.
  * The user can decide, if he additionally wants to receive these notifications as push notifications in within the mobile app. Push notifications are switched on by default.

===== Notifications =====

Notifications always relate to a message or an updated conversions, thus there are no additional defaults to the ones described for messages and conversations.
