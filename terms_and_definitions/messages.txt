====== Messages ======

  * sent from one user to another user
  * sent from user to himself

The user plans an [[terms_and_definitions:activity|activity]] which - based on his profile settings - causes “the system” (in most cases the [[terms_and_definitions:backend|backend]]) to create a calendar invitation (a message) sent to the user’s e-mail address.
